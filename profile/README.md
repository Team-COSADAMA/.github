## COSADAMA

```
The best way to do something is to produce something with someone.
```

Cosadama(2020-01-13 ~) is the programming boot camp by students of Chung-Ang university, Seoul, Korea. The group name "Cosadama" comes from the compound of  "CODING" and **"好事多魔"** which is a proverb meaning that you need to hard work to go right way and sounds 'ho-sa-da-ma'.
