## __COSADAMA__

```
The best way to do something is to produce something with someone.
```

Cosadama(2020-01-13 ~) is the programming boot camp by students of Chung-Ang university, Seoul, Korea. The group name "Cosadama" comes from the compound of  "CODING" and **"好事多魔"** which is a proverb meaning that you need to hard work to go right way and sounds 'ho-sa-da-ma'. The name means that we all finally go right way(maybe could be top programmer) after taking all the struggles, such as endless errors, back-ache etc. Then, Look forward to what we are!

## __Audience__
